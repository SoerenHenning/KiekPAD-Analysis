# KiekPAD

KiekPAD is a tool to detect and visualize performance anomalies in software systems with the [Kieker monitoring framework](http://kieker-monitoring.net/).
It consists of this analysis component and also of a [visualization component](https://github.com/SoerenHenning/KiekPAD-Viz-Provider).
Moreover, for its usage a Cassandra database is required and a RServe component could be set up for specific R-based algorithms.

This component is available as a [*Docker* image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/soerenhenning/kiekpad-analysis) and we also provide a
[*Docker Compose* file](https://build.se.informatik.uni-kiel.de/stu114708/KiekPAD-Compose) for KiekPAD.

Further information on KiekPad can be found in [Sören Henning´s bachelor´s thesis](http://eprints.uni-kiel.de/34141/).
